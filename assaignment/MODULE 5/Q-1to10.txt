    1 what do you understand by database

 ===>   A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, managed, and stored in a computer system. 
 ===>   It is designed to efficiently
        1) DBMS  (database management system)
        2) RDBMS ( relational database management system)

      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      2 what is normalization ?
===>    Normalization is a process in database design that helps eliminate data redundancy and improve data 
===>    integrity by organizing data into well-structured tables. It involves applying a set of rules and guidelines

        1 first normal form  (1FN)
        2 second normal form (2FN)
        3 third normal form  (3FN)
 
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      3 what is difference between DBMS and RDBMS?

           DBMS :  DBMS (DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM)
                   A DBMS can manage different types of databases, network, and relational. 
                   It may not necessarily follow a strict tabular structure and may allow more flexible data models.
            ===>   DBMS may or may not enforce data integrity constraints, such as  referential integrity, 
                   and data validation rules. 
          RDBMS :  RDBMS(RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM)
                   RDBMS specifically deals with relational databases. 
            ===>   RDBMS enforces strict data integrity constraints through various mechanisms like primary keys, foreign keys,
                   check constraints, and unique constraints.

       4 what is MF Cod rule of RDBMS system?
        
      1.) The Foundation Rule 
      2.) Inforamtion rule 
      3.) Gauranted Access Rule
      4.) Systematic Treatment of null values
      5.) Active online catalog based on the realtioanal model
      6.) Comprehensive Data SubLanguage Rule
      7.) View Updating Rule
      8.) Relational Level Operation Rule
      9.) Physical Data Independence Rule
      10.) Logical Data Independence Rule
      11.) Integrity Independence Rule
      12.) Distribution Independence Rule
      13.) Non Subversion Rule


    

  








       5 What do you understand by Data Redundancy?


             ===>    Data redundancy refers to the duplication or repetition of data within a database or information system. 
                   It occurs when the same data is stored in multiple locations or multiple instances of the same data exist
                   within a dataset. Data redundancy can occur unintentionally due to design flaws, data integration processes, 
                   or manual data entry errors.

              

        6 What is DDl interpreter

      
             ===>  A DDL (DATA DEFINITION LANGUAGE) interpreter is a component or software tool that is responsible 
                   for interpreting and executing DDL statements in a database management system (DBMS). 
                   DDL is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of a database, 
                   1) insert 

                   2) update

                   3) delete

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     

        7 What is DML compiler in SQL?


             ===> In SQL (Structured Query Language), a DML (Data Manipulation Language) compiler refers to the component 
                  responsible for parsing and executing DML statements. DML statements are used to manipulate data within 
                  a database, including operations such as inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        8  What is SQL key constraints writing an example of SQL key constraints

             ===> SQL, key constraints are used to define rules and relationships between columns or sets of columns 
                  in a table. They help enforce data integrity and maintain the integrity of the database.

                  types of key constraints:
                  1) primary key :- ALTER TABLE `TABLE_NAME` ADD PRIMARY KEY (`COLUMN NAME`);

                  2) unique key  :- ALTER TABLE `TABLE_NAME` ADD UNIQUE KEY (`COLUMN NAME`);

                  3)foreign key  :- ALTER TABLE `TABLE_NAME` ADD FOREIGN KEY (`COLUMN NAME`)REFERENCES 
                                      `REFERENCE_TABLE_NAME`(`COLUMN NAME`);

        9 What is save point? How to create a save point write a Query 

                 A SAVEPOINT is a point in a transaction wen you roll the transaction back to a certain point
                 without rolling back to the entire transaction

                  Query :- SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;


        10 What is trigger and how to create a trigger in SQL?


      ===>        a trigger is a stored a procedure in database  which a automatically invokes when ever a 
                  special event in the database  occurs
                  for example, a trigger can be invoked when a row is inserted in to a specified table.
      ===>        create trigger [trigger_name] [before_alter]
