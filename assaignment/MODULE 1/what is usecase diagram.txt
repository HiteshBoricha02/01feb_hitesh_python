    ==> A use case diagram is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram used to visualize and describe the functional requirements of a system or software application. 
        It is a high-level representation of how users interact with a system and the different ways in which it can be used to meet their needs.

    ==> The use case diagram includes actors (such as users, other systems or external entities) and use cases 
        (which represent specific tasks or goals that the system can perform to fulfill the needs of the actors).
        It shows the relationships and interactions between actors and use cases and provides an overview of the system's functionality.

    ==> Use case diagrams are used in the early stages of software development to identify the requirements of the system and to help stakeholders understand how the system will work.
    ==> They can also be used to communicate the system's
    ==> functionality to developers and other stakeholders throughout the development process.
